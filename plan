1. Ask the user to try logging in with Google again.
2. If it fails, ask them to check the URL in the browser address bar when they see the "No matching routes found" error.
3. Verify if the /test-http route works (I can't check it directly, but I can ask the user or infer from logs if I could see them).
4. If the error persists, it might be a Google Cloud Console configuration issue (Redirect URI mismatch or missing).
